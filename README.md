* maybe most interesting to you (in case you are working in Python) is the section `dataPythonReduced` (reduced <span>&#8658;</span> because it is the data on which finally, the benchmark was performed)
* load `dataPythonReduced`-data into Python https://github.com/ml-jku/lsc/blob/master/pythonCode/apred/loadData.py
* data download script: https://github.com/ml-jku/lsc/blob/master/download.sh (maybe you need only parts out of it, but maybe simpler to use than downloading by browser)
